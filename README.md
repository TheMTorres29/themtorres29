## Hey, what's up! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Miguel Torres.
I am a Computer Scientist that loves planning and problem solving. 
Main focus in Web Development but always down to learn new things on the computer!

Most recent project was a landing page for my Online Pokemon TCG Page using ReactJS, hosted [Here](https://themtorres29.github.io/MTCG-PokeStop-Page/) on Github :)
Another fun project of mine was this Smash Bros Ultimate Fighter Randomizer Web App [Here](https://www.random-smashdown.site/)

More cool pages on the way so keep an eye out!
